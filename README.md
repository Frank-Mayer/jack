- Are you annoyed by all the different build tools and think "I just want to run this code quickly"?
- Do you work with an editor like Vim and want to debug your Java code?
- Do you want to work on an IntelliJ project without having to install IntelliJ?

Jack solves these problems.

Don't worry, this is not yet another build tool that tries to replace Maven and Gradle. Those are
good tools and there is no need to replace them. The point is that you can work with any Java
project without worrying about what build tool is used and how that works.

**Currently there is only support for maven and IntelliJ projects. PRs are welcome!**
